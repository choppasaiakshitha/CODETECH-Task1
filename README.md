Project:SIMPLE CALCULATOR

Objective:
The objective of the project is to create a Python program that acts as a basic calculator. 
It should prompt the user to enter two numbers and choose an operation (addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division). Then, it should perform the selected operation and display the result
to the user.

Key Features:
User Input: The program prompts the user to input two numerical values. 
These values can be floating-point numbers to accommodate both integers and decimals.
Operation Selection: The user is provided with a choice of four basic arithmetic 
Operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
Conditional Logic: The program uses conditional statements (if-elif-else) to determine
which operation to perform based on the user's input.
Output: After performing the selected operation, the program displays the result to the user.
Error Handling: The program includes basic error handling, such as checking for division by 
zero,to ensure it doesn't crash or produce invalid results.

Technologies Used:
Python: The project is implemented using Python, leveraging its simple syntax and built-in 
functions for user input and basic mathematical operations.
